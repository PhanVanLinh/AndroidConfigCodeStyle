# AndroidConfigCodeStyle

> To config code style formatting we will use **Scheme**

- Go to File->Setting->Editor->CodeStyle. At top we will see the **scheme**
- There are 2 type of scheme, **project scheme** (will apply only for current project) (eg: `Project`) and **IDE scheme**
(will apply for all project after created) (eg: `Default Scheme`). We can create a custom **project scheme** or **IDE scheme**
-> exported then share to another team member for import
- We can quickly see the current **scheme** by `Help->File Action -> Scheme`

### Tips
- To reformat code all project code: Right click in project root -> click `Reformat code`
- If we using GUI for commit, there are some option like `Reformat code`, `Optimize import`, ... before commit
